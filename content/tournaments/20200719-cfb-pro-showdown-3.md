CFB Pro Showdown #3 was a single-elimination, Standard format tournament
accessible to the [Channel Fireball
Pro](https://www.channelfireball.com/all-strategy/pro/) members, free of
charge. The prizes are awarded in the form of CFB credit. The winner of the
tournament plays a match against a CFB Pro (in this instance, Luis
Scott-Vargas) and doubles the prizes for everyone if they beat them. The
tournament is run via the Channel Fireball Events system and Discord.

The tournament was happening on the same day as [Red Bull Untapped
International Qualifier
III](https://magic.afri.cz/tournaments/20200719-redbull-untapped-iq-iii/). The
timing was very convenient because the Red Bull tournament was happening during
the day in European timezones. The CFB Pro Showdown started on Pacific morning,
so it was possible to finish the Red Bull tournament, rest, and start the CFB
Pro one.

Like in the Red Bull tournament, I was decided to play Bant Ramp deck. Although
my performance with it earlier in the day was not stellar, it is still a strong
deck. And after piloting it in the competitive setting for a full day, I felt I
can even play it better.

# Games

G1, Orzhov Rats. 2-0. This was an exciting, on-the-edge match. I tried to
pressure a lot in the air with sharks and Krasises. I focused on not allowing
Yorion to generate a lot of value by disturbing their plays, bouncing
permanents back, and the like. There were some really tricky plays when Doom
Foretold was involved because a lot of my things are tokens. There were
definitely opportunities where things could go sideways. Still, I felt like I'm
in perfect control of the match.

G2, Red Aggro with Torbran. 2-1. I lost the first game being on the draw and
won the second on the play after sideboard. The third one was very close. I was
pretty close to losing when I was at 4 life, the opponent had a board, and I
had just a Nissa and not enough cards in graveyard to escape with Uro. I needed
to make a creature from a land and sweep the board after floating the mana.
That gave me the fifth card for Uro to escape and gain some life after sweeping
the opponent's board.

G3, Temur Reclamation. 0-2. I think the opponent ended up in the Top 4 or
something like that. Very tightly played Temur Reclamation. One of the games
where I felt I have just no window of opportunity at all. And because the
tournament was a single-elimination one, I was out.

# Summary

While the system running the tournament is not as pleasant to use as the one
used for the Red Bull Untapped tournaments, it works well enough. Single
elimination is punishing but allows to make things quick. I was a bit salty in
the round I lost because, in that round, approximately third of players got
byes to balance the tournament brackets and got a freebie, whereas I lost and
was out. The good part was the improvement: in the previous tournaments I was
out after the first or second round, this time I was out in the third, and felt
good about my play.
