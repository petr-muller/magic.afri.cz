Compared to the previous tournament, I had some time and opportunity to test
the meta on the ladder and practice the deck I wanted to play in the event. I
stopped resisting reality and chose to play the Bant Ramp deck.

# Bant Ramp

I played the variant described by Andrea Mengucci in his [CFB Pro
article](https://www.channelfireball.com/all-strategy/andrea-mengucci-2/deep-dive-bant-ramp/).
I was really impressed by that post: the amount of work that went into it
really shows. The insights into gameplay for that deck are priceless—really
cool stuff. I am not much of a deck builder, so I did not attempt to tune it.
Still, I have not followed the sideboard guide too strictly. What you actually
see the opponents play matters a lot. Compared to the last week's choice of
Mono-Green Aggro, I felt like I play a much better deck with more information
about how to play it.

# Fast 0-3, again

G1, Rakdos Sacrifice: First game was really grindy and lengthy. I managed to
win it by accumulating value over time with planeswalkers and staying alive
using Uro and Krasis-es. I lost the second game really fast: cat into two
ovens, into midnight reaper, which I swept, but opponent placed a Mayhem Devil
and another oven. Hard to come back from that. I lost even the third game and
went 0-1.

G2, Mono-Green Aggro. I made some mistakes and lost 1-2 to *just enough* bite
removal, followed by card-drawing engines like the deathtouch elf and Great
Henge, to which I never had an answer in time. I think this is where early
sub-optimal plays manifest: if I use my cards optimally, I would not be missing
answers. I also think I sided poorly into the copious amount of bite removal.
Although I was 0-2, I still decided to continue playing to get some play
experience.

G3, Bant Ramp. I had to mulligan to five, but even with that, the game was
actually quite long and grindy. Eventually, the opponent snowballed too much
and won. I won the second game quickly with Jolrael. The third was again a long
grind. I ultimately lost because the opponent played an unanswered Nissa and
won in the ECD management mini-game. 0-3.

# Remaining rounds

It is interesting to observe what kind of decks and players does one meet in
the later rounds as a loser. Many competitive players drop after a 0-2 start,
so you start to meet some peculiar and unexpected decks played by people who
definitely want to have some fun.

In the fourth match, I played against a very crazy BW deck with apparently some
lifegain synergies, but it frankly made very little sense. Even that way, I
managed to almost lose one game where I did not kill my opponent with Jolrael's
activated ability, and almost got punished by that. Fortunately for me, the
opposing deck was terrible enough for me to make away with it, and I got my
first win of the day.

I did not take detailed notes after the fourth round. I won the next match
against a Mono-Green Aggro and lost the next one against a cute Mardu Midrange
deck, which used some deathtouch/bite combos. I lost a match against a Temur
Reclamation and won the last one against another Temur deck.

# Summary

Even with a stronger deck and more experience playing it, I ended up with the
same result as [last
week](https://magic.afri.cz/tournaments/20200713-redbull-untapped-iq-ii/), when
I played Mono-Green Aggro without much preparation. The lesson here is that the
deck is not everything: I still need to play it better.

Red Bull tournaments are very nice to play: reasonably competitive and well
organized; I do not remember of any organizational hiccup. The system is quite
pleasant to use. I also enjoyed the giveaways in the Twitch chat. Although the
stream and coverage are not as polished as some of the other Magic tournaments,
it was entertaining enough to watch. I would like to see more structure
covering the event itself (compared to individual games) in the stream though:
round recaps, the performance of interesting names, surprising decks...
Generally, more content that would frame the single games as parts of a larger
event.
