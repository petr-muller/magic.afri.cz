CFB Pro Showdown is a series of Channel Fireball tournaments for their Pro (paid
content tier) members. It is a single-elimination tournament organized via
Discord. This time (I think it was the first time for CFB Pro Showdown), it was
run in [MTGMelee](https://mtgmelee.com/), a significant improvement over the
previously used system.

# Metagame and Preparation

After the last round of Standard bans (**Omnath**, **Lucky Clover**, and **Escape to
the Wilds** were all banned, and **Uro** was banned before that), the metagame
looked quite diverse and creature-oriented. I did not have that much time to play
on the ladder, but I looked at the stats, and it was mostly a mixture of Red
Aggro, UB Rogues (often crossbred with mill), many green creature decks,
sometimes with Red for **Embercleave**. I did not have a preference, but this week
I had some time to invest in testing and playing a few decks. I ended up trying
two things: Temur Ramp and Rakdos Midrange; both built on the CFB Pro content.

## Temur Ramp

[Deck Guide: Standard Temur Ramp](https://strategy.channelfireball.com/all-strategy/cfb-pro-content/deck-guide-standard-temur-ramp/)

An **Omnath** deck without an **Omnath**, ramping up with **Beanstalk Giant**, **Lotus
Cobra**, and **Cultivate**, hoping to win the game with a **Genesis Ultimatum** or
**Ugin**. I played against Dimir Control, Rakdos Midrange, and Selesnya
Enchantments on the ladder. 

I overall liked the deck, but it was quite vulnerable to various things: 
sometimes, the game was all ramp and no payoffs. Counters are bad because they
are very efficient against my expensive spells, and I rarely doublespell, even
with all the ramp. The hand disruption by Rakdos Midrange is annoying too: the
ramp deck tends to keep the expensive spells in hand, and an early **Kroxa** can
devastate all plans.

Also, I was not too fond of the lack of defense against flying creatures and the
lack of removal against creatures with 3+ toughness. I tuned the deck a bit
(added Shark Typhoons, which are great against both countermagic and flyers).
Overall, it felt good when everything went well, but very it was vulnerable.

## Rakdos Midrange

[](https://strategy.channelfireball.com/all-strategy/cfb-pro-content/standard-rakdos-midrange-deck-guide/)

This deck was a contender even in **Omnath** times. I kept the deck mostly
unchanged, except for the sideboard. I expected a different metagame than for
which the deck was built, so I made some changes to accommodate that. I played
four matches on the ladder: against Golgari Adventures, Esper Doom, Azorius
Control, and Dimir Control. All the matches were hard, but I never felt without
any chance to win. The deck is very resilient and can get even from the direst
situations. Graveyard hate makes the deck hard, and the Golgari deck beat me with
a **Scavenging Ooze** and **Great Henge**.

I tuned the sideboard a bit more, adding **Feed the Swarm** to deal with
enchantments, especially in the **Doom Foretold** deck.

## Expected Meta

I was expecting to see a lot of Dimir Control, Dimir Rogues (maybe with milling)
and Rakdos Midrange, also Mono-Red Aggro (but not that much; it is hard to win
eight matches in a row with the current Mono-Red Aggro - the deck is not that
consistent).

# Deck

From the two options I have tried, I selected the Rakdos Midrange one. I liked
the resiliency of the deck and its portfolio of answers against pretty much
anything. There is plenty of spot removal against creatures, something against
planeswalkers, artifacts, and enchantments. Kroxa and other recursive
threats help to beat controls. There is no good sweeper, but I was not expecting
any go-wide strategies.

# Games

## Marius Badea, Orzhov Yorion

I spammed cheap targets for **Doom Foretold** to make it eat itself, not generate
additional value and protect my essential permanents. Both matches were long and
grindy, but Kroxa would eventually stick, generate value, and apply pressure.
When that happened, the opponent plays the topdeck game. A big problem was a
**Castle Ardenvale** generating chump blockers together with **Omen of the Sun**. My
threats do not trample, so the 1/1 blockers clog the board quite effectively. I
boarded on the **Feed the Swarm** copies to deal with nasty enchantments, and it
worked well.

**Result:** 2-0

## Dana Fischer, Abzan Midrange

OK, this was a match for which I did not have a plan. The matchup itself is from
hell, and Dana played well, too. I did not have any answer (even in the
sideboard) for **Garruk's Harbinger**, **Lavabrink Venturer**, and planeswalkers! I
started on the draw and was decisively beaten to a pulp: T2 Ooze (dammit),
T3 Harbinger (Dammit), T4 **Questing Beast**. No chance. The second game was a bit
closer, although my sideboard did not contain many options useful against such a
deck. Dana managed the board very well for a Venturer to be efficient and
eventually killed me. I felt like I had no real chance in both games, but
really, that deck was brilliant against mine, and I was unprepared for it.

**Result:** 0-2

---

The tournament was single-elimination, so tough luck, finished with a 1-1 record
in the second round. Ondřej Stráský won the whole thing with Selesnya Yorion, so
I guess I at least know what I am meeting in the ladder all the time next week.
